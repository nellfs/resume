  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I was born in Brazil in 2002, and I've been keeping things moving since then.
    I'm a fan of hardware emulation, especially for retro video-game consoles.
    I started programming as a teenager, developing game engines at a time when engines weren't as accessible as they
    are today.
    Today, I work as a software developer focused on modern Web backend development.
